                <p>The technology industry is becoming increasingly gender inclusive, and at Girl Power Talk, we consciously hire women for tech roles. Women, nonbinary individuals, and men work side by side on coding, UI/UX design, SEO, and data science teams. The resulting confluence of ideas, styles, and strengths affords our clients a competitive advantage when developing solutions for their challenges. Our growing team of young women in tech are leading by example for younger girls interested in pursuing STEM careers.</p>
