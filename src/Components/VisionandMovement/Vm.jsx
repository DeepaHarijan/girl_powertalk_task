    <h1 class="vmheading"> <span> </span> Starting a Movement</h1>
        <p>Girl Power Talk was founded on the idea that young India needs an innovative new work culture that equally harnesses peopleâ€™s talents, irrespective of their gender. Girl Power Talk is more than a company. We are a movement rooted in empowerment, professional ambition, and social impact. For generations, women have been relegated to secondary roles, and the youth exploited for their energy and inexperience.
             We are a culture that will make history by changing this dynamic and writing the beautiful next chapter in this story.</p>
